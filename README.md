A set of JS used in googlesheets to filter and display 50 character guild statistics for SWGOH by collecting data from swgoh.gg's api. v.2 is working, although sluggishly, too many formulas in the sheet. In v.3 I'll break those into scripts, storing json files in google drive to help limit api requests.
